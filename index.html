  <h1><center>Real Life Applications</center></h1>
<p><center>In recent years technology has made many advances, one of those advances is the development of Virtual assistants. Many people use virtual assistants to make their day-to-day tasks easier. Virtual assistants are very useful and have many benefits including using your voice commands to carry out actions (commands such as set an alarm, send a text message, set a reminder, read information from websites). Virtual assistants being able to complete tasks like this are efficient and promote multi-tasking, it’s much easier to just shout out a command and get the task you need completed, or information you need relayed to you than it is to take the time and manually do it yourself.  One action that amazon’s virtual assistant can complete that most virtual assistants cannot is order products off amazon. Overall, virtual assistants are a great addition to our lives.  </center></p>
<p><center>Another application of virtual assistants is that they can complete complex things such as locking your doors, turning on/off lights, and changing the temperature on the thermostat. This is specific to amazons Alexa, but virtual assistants can now aid in the medical field, they can detect illnesses such as colds through user’s voice, help manage blood pressure, and diabetes, instruction on first aid techniques. A lot of these medical features relating to the medical field are very useful, in an emergency you could be clueless, but with a simple command your virtual assistant could tell you everything you need to know. The same concepts apply to dealing with diseases/illnesses, for example if a person with diabetes has high blood sugar asks the virtual assistant what to do the virtual assistant will tell them the steps, they need to take to get their blood sugar back down.  These are only a few of the many things that virtual assistants can accomplish.   </center></p>

<p><center> Challenges</center></p>
<p><center>Just like with most technology there are social challenges with virtual assistants. A lot of people don’t trust virtual assistants because they actively listen to your conversations and even at times record them. There is one example of Alexa recording an alleged murder suspect, in this case the recording let the authorities know what happened, but many people weren’t happy to know this because they aren’t happy with companies having accesses to their personal conversations. It makes it difficult to implement these types of devices in your home since you will be compromising your privacy. </center></p>
